# Hi, I'm Jorshua Hernandez ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently trying to relearn everything about web development, got a interest in mobile development but currently more interested in Android than IOS

I made this account only to keep track of my learning progress, but in the future i hope to be a contribuitor in the community so please keep an eye in my progress, if you got a suggestion about anything let me know so i can keep that in mind and probably get a little better in later interactions

> in my mind, the go-to goal is getting at least a walkaround of what is to be a full-stack developer but i'm more interested in the whole backend thing so i'll be working first in the frontend side but also giving a look sometimes to the backend side so i could star getting a idea of that world



#### With that in mind, this is the track i'll be following

i have complete the basics of html and css, i'm currently working in my portfolio alongside learning javascript, and looking into php

- Re-make the github pages and sub pages previously created for a small bussiness 

- - Portfolio v-1
  
  - Veterambiental v-2

  - Markdown viewer
  
  - A pizza dinamic select menu
  
  - Reactive new page

> im workin' with react, vue is good but it's troublesome with the documentation from v2 to v3 and the vast majority of information goes with v2 even v1 so i will try to get a steady ground with react but it also have the same problems with the changes between new versions
